Master:
FIXED!
something blocks. Occurs regularily as slave is terminated
-	The Node does not exit master
-	The elevator does not process cab buttons
IF no hall orders are made, the blocking does not occur - for the most part
When the Master blocks, the NodeStateServer never prints, meaning it too is blocked
When one pc lost connection to the network, the blocking occured (with no hall orders)
When distributing orders, the master sometimes blocks
This happens while sending repeatedly to the channel ElevLightAndAssignmentUpdate
it is wierd to me how all the other go routines also seem to stop (nodeStateServer)
It never prints, even though it should??


Slave:
Seemingly does not update lights on entry, takes one button press to begin
