TODO:

ALL TRANSMITTERS NEED TO BE ENABLED/DISABLED BASED ON WHAT STATE YOU ARE IN
THIS IS A GOOD ARGUMENT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TRANSMITTERS

- Elevator
    Add channel for updating hall lights (as hall light must be lit if any of the elevators are performing a hall assignment)
    Merge channel for IsDoorStuck with checking if elevator is initialised (not in-between floors at startup)
    Add channel for sending cab buttons from node to elevator

- Node
    setup all transmitters and channels

- Slave
    Master timeout detection

- Master
    Make logic for control of lights
    Make logic for detecting a node connect/disconnect

- In Elevator_sys.go
    Why is there struct elevator and a struct  elevator states that contain the exact same fields except one?

- NodeElevStateServer
    Notify if a node has fallen out 

- Disconnected 
    Make logic for receiving your states from master

- Everywhere
    Filter out messages from myself

Unsafe operations are happening in elevator
For instance, transferElevStates does not work and should not be written this way even if it did work
