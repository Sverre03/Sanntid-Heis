Master:
FIXED!
something blocks. Occurs regularily as slave is terminated
-	The Node does not exit master
-	The elevator does not process cab buttons
IF no hall orders are made, the blocking does not occur - for the most part
When the Master blocks, the NodeStateServer never prints, meaning it too is blocked
When one pc lost connection to the network, the blocking occured (with no hall orders)
When distributing orders, the master sometimes blocks
This happens while sending repeatedly to the channel ElevLightAndAssignmentUpdate
it is wierd to me how all the other go routines also seem to stop (nodeStateServer)
It never prints, even though it should??


Slave:
Seemingly does not update lights on entry, takes one button press to begin

Bug: Master gets stuck if hall buttons are spammed (held in) on its local elevator
Seems to overload (block) one or more channels if local hall buttons are pressed. Master also gets stuck when spamming hall buttons on slave elevators (but usually takes more time before getting stuck). Spamming the cab buttons never cause any issues, pointing to this being an issue with channels (ofc).
